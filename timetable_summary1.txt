Shifts: Increasing the shift value from 5 to 10 resulted in a reduction in the minimum clashes from 20 to 15.
Iterations: With 5 iterations, the clashes decreased gradually with each step.
Summary: Higher shift values led to better optimization, and increasing the number of iterations contributed to further reduction in clashes.
