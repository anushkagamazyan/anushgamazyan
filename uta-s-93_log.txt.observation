Shift 1: The number of clashes decreases steadily with more iterations, showing significant improvement at 20 and 30 iterations. The optimal step is typically found near the later stages of the iterations.
Shift 2: This shows a slight improvement over Shift 1, with fewer clashes at similar steps. This indicates that a higher shift value may allow the algorithm to explore better solutions faster.
Shift 3: This trend continues with even better results, especially in the 30-iteration case, where the minimum clashes reach a low of 7. This suggests that increasing the shift value can be beneficial for reducing the number of clashes.
