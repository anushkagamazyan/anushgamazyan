Shift 1: Similar to uta-s-93, there is a gradual reduction in the number of clashes as iterations increase. However, the overall number of clashes remains higher compared to uta-s-93.
Shift 2: There is a noticeable improvement with fewer clashes in the 20 and 30 iteration cases. This suggests that a higher shift helps reduce clashes more effectively than Shift 1.
Shift 3: This shift value continues to show better performance, with a minimum of 15 clashes in the 30-iteration case. This again reinforces the idea that increasing the shift value aids in finding better solutions.
